git clone https://github.com/ParadoxZero/sfml-snake.git
cd sfml-snake
make build
```

### Manual build steps using cmake

- `git clone https://github.com/ParadoxZero/sfml-snake.git`
- Create a directory for cmake , e.g. - `mkdir build`
- `cd build`
- `cmake .. -G Ninja` or `cmake ..` (to use the default build system)
- `ninja snake` or `make snake` (depending on your selected build system)
 
## Contribution
 
  * Lot's of work remaining.
     * GUI Menu (see https://github.com/ParadoxZero/GameMenu-cpp)
     * Settings and user data save system.
     * Sound
  * In case you are woundering about the extra complication in moving snake -
      That is done in order to smoothen the animation of movement. To have slower/ variable speed of snake
      in *Higher framerate*

Feel free to fork, fix the issues and contribute. Help is always welcome.
